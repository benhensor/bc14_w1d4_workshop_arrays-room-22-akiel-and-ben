# Arrays

Create an HTML file named index.html and a JS file named main.js in this folder. Link them with a script tag. In main.js, work through the following tasks.

## Task 1 - Declaring an Array

Convert these lists of things into JavaScript arrays.

For example...

- Cheese
- Chocolate
- Olives
- Anchovies

Would become...

```js
const favoriteFoods = ["Cheese", "Chocolate", "Olives", "Anchovies"];
```

ðŸ‘‰ You do the rest!

### 1. Favorite Songs

- Tiny Dancer
- Running Up That Hill
- Don't Stop Moving
- Tragedy
- Crazy Horses

### 2. Profit From First Seven Days of the School of Code's Penny Doubling Pyramid Scheme ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

- 1
- 2
- 4
- 8
- 16
- 32
- 64

### 3. Friends

- Name is Chris; special skill is changing lives.
- Name is Lizzie; special skill is being friendly.
- Name is Ben; special skill is code rapping.
- Name is Tao; special skill is hand raising.
- Name is Liz; special skill is crochet.
- Name is Patrick; special skill is Call of Duty.
- Name is Tim; special skill is analogies.
- Name is James; special skill is friendship.
- Name is Joseph; special skill is being positive.
- Name is Max; special skill is papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.

## Task 2 - Reading Array Values

```js
let options = [
  "Jan",
  "Feb",
  "Mar",
  "Apr",
  "May",
  "Jun",
  "Jul",
  "Aug",
  "Sep",
  "Oct",
  "Nov",
  "Dec",
];
```

Using bracket notation and the correct index, for each person...

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log the month in which you were born.

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log the month your mother was born.

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log your favorite month.

## Task 3 - Looping and Accessing

We can use the useful loops we learned to access the items in an array.

```js
let englishNumbers = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];
```

ðŸ‘‰ Declare an index variable and assign it the value of 0.

ðŸ‘‰ In a while loop, console.log the array item at the current index and add 1 to the index variable.

ðŸ‘‰ Have the while loop run until the index is equal to or greater than the array's length property.

## Task 4 - Looping and Accessing

ðŸ‘‰ Refactor task three to use a for loop instead of a while loop.

## Task 5 - Looping and Reassigning

```js
let words = ["ben", "ha", "spla", "fa", "ca", "dra"];
// for loop goes here

console.log(words);
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use a for loop to iterate over the words array and add the letter t to the end of each word ("ben" becomes "bent", "ha" becomes "hat", etc.).

## Task 6 - Get Experimental

ðŸ‘‰ Explore arrays more. For example, you could...

- Create nested arrays and objects.
- Create functions that take in information and use that information to create or change arrays.
- Find a way to write a function that gives back a random item in the array.
- Look online in documentation (for example, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)) about arrays in JavaScript. Can you find anything new or surprising?
